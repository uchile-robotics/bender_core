class Robot(object):
    """
    Robot is a container/manager of all the skills a robot can be built of.
    The robot maintains a dictionary of skills, whose keys are retrieved from
    the '<robot_skill>.get_type()' method

    Robot class provides the following public API:
    // single skill methods
    - has:   checks for a RobotSkill
    - get:   gets a RobotSkill
    - set:   sets a RobotSkill
    
    // multiple skills
    - check: checks skills integrity
    - setup: setups registered skills
    - start: starts all or a single skill and its dependencies recursively
    - pause: pauses all or a single skill and its parents recursively
    - shutdown: turns off all or a single skill and its parents recursively
    
    Whenever shutdown(), start() or pause() methods are called:
    - they work only on the registered skill graph. Is your responsibility to
     register the required dependencies when building the robot.
    - 
    - except the above point, do not assume there is an order in the calling
     of methods.
    TODO: The same for check() and setup()

    WARNING: Setting skills after any call to check(), setup(), start(),
     pause()  or shutdown() is not currently supported!. Bad stuff will 
     happen!.


    example:
    # build the robot
    >>> bender = Robot("manipulator bot")
    >>> bender = set(ArmSkill.get_instance())
    >>> bender = set(GripperSkill.get_instance())
    >>> bender = set(HeadSkill.get_instance())
    >>> bender = set(RGBDSkill.get_instance())
    >>> bender = set(JoySkill.get_instance())
    >>> print bender

    # prepare
    >>> bender.check()
    >>> bender.setup()

    # start the gripper and its dependencies (arm and joy)
    >>> bender.start(GripperSkill.get_type())

    # do something
    >>> gripper = bender.get(GripperSkill.get_type())
    >>> gripper.some_fantastic_function()
